# Current State

### Issues

  - 'change' will not work because eg. 'keystrokes' has multiple properties


### Next Steps

  - process the google sheet change-modifications in file test/modifications-change.js
  - auto-resolve warning/info notifications (implement button actions)
  - package de-/activation during runtime
  - save changes and restore on deactication
  - cache changes made last time to speed up processing next time
    (packages are load in alphabetical order of the path)
